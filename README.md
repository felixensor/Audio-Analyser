The provided code may be used to analyse simple tunes that consist of beeps of specific frequencies with their durations and gaps in between.

The output of the script is printed in the format:

beep(Frequency, Duration Milliseconds);
delay(Duration Milliseconds);
... next beep and delay

The reason for this formatting was for ease of use when converting to arduino code to reproduce the tune through a piezo buzzer.

I hope you find this helpful.
